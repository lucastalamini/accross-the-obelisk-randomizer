### Make Commands

This project uses make commands to simplify simple tasks like setting up a XAMPP server to host the webpage.

* `make xampp`: Initializes a Docker image hosting the directories files without need for installation on the host machine. After a successful run of the command, visit `http://localhost:41062/www/randomizer-form.html` to check the page out.
